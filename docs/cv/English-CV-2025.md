## Projects

### 1. High-Performance API & Microservices Exploration (2025)
- **Situation**: Identified the need to build a high-performance, secure system to handle microservices communication.
- **Task**: To develop a proof-of-concept API using Rust and Deno, exploring different communication protocols and secure data transfer.
- **Action**: 
  - Designed and built a REST API using **Deno** and a high-performance backend using **Axum (Rust)**, exchanging data via Server Actions.
  - Explored and implemented **gRPC with TLS 1.3** to secure communication between a Rust client and a Rust API.
  - Successfully debugged and resolved incompatibility issues between Deno and the gRPC/TLS setup by isolating the problem and proving functionality with a Rust client.
  - Managed sensitive files (`.key`, `.pem`) with `.gitignore` to maintain security.
- **Result**: Gained practical experience with advanced protocols (**gRPC, TLS**) and high-performance languages (**Rust**), proving the ability to solve complex system-level problems and maintain secure configurations.

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline for Python Package (2025)
- **Situation**: Needed an automated system to manage the versioning and deployment of a personal Python package.
- **Task**: To build a simple, reliable CI/CD pipeline using familiar tools without relying on heavy frameworks like Jenkins.
- **Action**: 
  - Created a custom **Lua script** to extract and automatically increment the package version in `__init__.py`.
  - Configured a Git pipeline to trigger on the `release` branch, executing the Lua script and pushing the new version.
  - Practiced package management and dependency isolation using `requirements-dev`, `requirements-db`, and `requirements-api` files.
- **Result**: Successfully automated the versioning process, demonstrating a foundational understanding of CI/CD, DevOps, and scripting for automation.

### 3. Full-Stack Web Application Deployment (2024)
- **Situation**: Wanted to build and deploy a full-stack application to production, integrating different technologies.
- **Task**: To develop a functional web app with a backend and deploy it to a cloud service.
- **Action**: 
  - Developed a web app using **Next.js**, a **Kotlin** backend, and a **Docker** container for easy deployment.
  - Deployed the container to AWS, demonstrating the ability to manage and provision cloud resources.
  - Used **GitHub Projects** and a Kanban board for effective task management and project tracking.
- **Result**: Successfully deployed a working application, gaining critical experience in full-stack integration, Docker, and cloud deployment, which provided valuable feedback on user experience and product maturity.
