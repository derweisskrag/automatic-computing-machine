# Deployment

## Overview

1. Exporting the Python Model
Since your model is trained in Python, you’ll need to export it in a format that Rust can use:

ONNX: A great choice for interoperability.

SavedModel (TensorFlow): If using TensorFlow, export as a .pb file.

Pickle or JSON: If using scikit-learn, serialize the model.

2. Loading the Model in Rust
Rust can load the model using:

onnxruntime-rs (for ONNX models).

tch-rs (for PyTorch models).

ndarray or serde_json (for simpler models).

3. Zig as a Bridge
Zig can help Rust interact with Python efficiently:

FFI (Foreign Function Interface): Zig can wrap Python’s C API, allowing Rust to call Python functions.

cargo-zigbuild: A tool that helps compile Rust projects with Zig for better cross-platform compatibility.

Zig’s C Interop: Zig can directly call C functions, making it easier to integrate Python’s C-based libraries.

4. Rust Exposing the Model to Kotlin
Rust can expose the model via:

gRPC: Efficient for structured data.

REST API: Using Axum or Actix-web.

WebAssembly (WASM): If running in a browser.

5. Kotlin Backend Serving Next.js
Your Kotlin backend can:

Call Rust via JNI (Java Native Interface).

Use HTTP/gRPC to fetch predictions.

Serve results to Next.js via an API.
