"""
This module demonstrates how to import another Python module by 
modifying `sys.path` manually using `os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "..")`.

This approach is sometimes referred to as a "magic method" because it
lets Python dynamically discover sibling or parent directories at runtime.

Use case: perfect for quick CLI tools, local testing, or scripting
when you don't want to configure full package paths or use `importlib`.

# Assume the target module is located two levels up from current directory

parent_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(cwd, "../.."))
